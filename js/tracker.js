//TO DO's:
//Take in user input for number to track
//Display input for # Remaining
//Add onclick functionality to count down from number input
//Display today's date and how many days are left in the year
//Add functionality to Oops button (increase number input for accidental clicks)
//Display motivational quote and change every time app loads (pull from an API?)
//Add functionality for when goal is met (TBD)

//HTML TO DO's:
//Create a page for first time load to take in the user input, but save info
//so the user doesn't lose their count when the app is closed
//*MAYBE* - Add a button to start over at any time? Or instead of buttons, add
//headers at the top??
